The purpose of this repository is to develop a testcase which will check that the Spring framework bundles
resolve inside an OSGi container. See https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-8791.

The testcase could be made more efficient by cacheing Spring bundles in the local Maven repository, but since it
is intended for running inside the Spring build, this may not be particularly helpful and may even cause problems
if a build is re-spun to change the OSGi metadata without modifying the version to be published.

Pre-req's
=========

Gradle 1.0-milestone-6 was used for building. This should be installed as documented here: http://www.gradle.org/installation

Building
========

gradle clean test

Using Eclipse
=============

Since Gradle generates Eclipse .classpath files which contain absolute paths on the user's machine, these are not checked in.
You should generate your own:

gradle eclipse
